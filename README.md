Designed a web application named “Play with text” and hosted it using Google App Engine. The Web application allows users to perform operations like Data Encryption and Decryption, Retrieving Text Statistics, Checking Occurrences and Hashing on the text. The application uses Google User Management service which prompts every user to log in using their Gmail.

This web service is used to validate if a number is prime or not. a.First the user has to click on 'Click me to log in' b.The website prompts for username and password of the user's google account c.Enter a number into the textbox and click 'Submit'. The result is displayed whether the number is prime or not beneath the textbox. d.There is a link named "Click me to log off" by which the user can log out. Entering very large numbers may cause an overflow. The largest number I enetered was a 7 digit number. It uses 2 google appengine services-
